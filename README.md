The above article discusses the intersection of programming as a software developer and *getting in the flow*. It outlines what the flow is, the history of the flow, and how to incorperte the flow into `software development`. A point I find particularly interesting from the article is how software development can be easily regarded as a creative act. I also appreiciate how the article provides a list of actionable things that help facilitate getting into the flow.

I found this article to be interesting as it discusses the importance and impact of getting into the flow. Personally, when I read that code was described as a creative act I immediately agreed because there's nothing better when you have music playing and you're in the 'zone' or 'flow' and coding is so much fun, especially when there are no bugs! Everything the article discussed from optimizing your environment to finding joy in the work you're doing was nicely explained and works because I've done some of those things before I start any coding homework or coding on my free time. 

#comment from Jimaiao Li:
What I find interesting about the article is its emphasis on the 
importance of achieving the flow state in coding and engineering. It 
highlights the profound impact this mental state can have on productivity 
and creativity, which is especially relevant in the fast-paced and 
demanding field of software development. The article also provides 
practical tips for readers to enhance their ability to enter the flow 
state, offering valuable insights into how individuals can optimize their 
coding experiences and ultimately excel in their engineering work.
