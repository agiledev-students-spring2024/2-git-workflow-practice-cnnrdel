The above article discusses the intersection of programming as a software developer and *getting in the flow*. It outlines what the flow is, the history of the flow, and how to incorperte the flow into `software development`. A point I find particularly interesting from the article is how software development can be easily regarded as a creative act. I also appreiciate how the article provides a list of actionable things that help facilitate getting into the flow.
